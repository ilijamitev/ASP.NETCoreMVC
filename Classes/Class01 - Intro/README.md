# ASP.NET and MVC Explained üç©

## ASP.NET

ASP.NET (Active Server Pages Network Enabled Technologies) is a framework that is specifically designed for building server-side web applications. With this framework we can build end-to-end solutions with or without front-end. There are many features that help us handle HTTP requests, configure web applications, route URL addresses as well as some front-end systems that help us easily integrate our front-end and back-end. The framework was first built for the .NET Full Framework, but later got an upgrade to .NET Core and became ASP.NET Core, which made it compatible with other platforms such as Linux and Mac.

### Difference between C#, .NET, ASP.NET and Visual Studio

- C# - A programming language containig unique syntax that has some meaning
  - Can be written in any .cs file, but can't build or run on it's own
  - Ex: The code inside of a console application is C#
- .NET - A software framework that makes developing applications with C# really easy
  - It contains a compiler that copiles and executeds C# code
  - It contains other features that help with running and managing C# code
  - There are 2 versions of .NET Framework
    - The .NET Full Framework which is the old version and not cross-platform
    - The .NET Core Framework which is the new version and cross-platform
  - Ex: When you hit RUN, the code is compiled and is running by the .NET Framework
- ASP.NET - A .NET based framework for building web applications using C#
  - It contains libraries that implement all web features such as HTTP requests handling
  - It can support solutions with or without a front-end
  - Ex: When you create a web server with views that are connected to that web server, running with the .NET Compiler and written in C#
- Visual Studio - IDE that helps us develop any solution using Microsoft Tech including ASP.NET applications, any .NET based applications and anything built with C#
  - It contains project templates so we don't have to write things from scratch
    - Like the Console app, it also contains templates for Web Applications using ASP.NET
    - ASP.NET MVC is one of the templates available
  - It has features that help us during development such as suggestions, syntax errors and warnings, code snippets and much more
  - Ex: When you create an ASP.NET project from a Visual Studio template, you write C# code in it and then compile it and run it through the .NET Framework compiler

## MVC

MVC or Model View Controller is a design pattern that is used in organizing and structuring applications. Since it is not fixed to technology, programming language, or company we can use this design pattern every time we build an application whether it is a web application, desktop application, mobile, etc.

## What is a Design Pattern üîπ

A design pattern is not a technology. It is not some code. It is not some framework that we download. Design patterns are structured ideas or concepts that solve some problem and can be followed to solve the problem of the same nature in the future. In a way, they are well structured, documented, and organized solutions and since they are not connected to any specific language or technology we can solve problems with them whenever we need them in whatever technology and language. MVC is an architectural design pattern meaning that it resolves issues with the organization and structuring of software architecture. In simple terms, it helps us organize our folder, file, and entity structure as well as their communication so that we have a better organized, readable, secure, and scalable software solution. A lot of times MVC is confused with a framework since a lot of frameworks use MVC as their main architectural pattern, but the MVC is just the idea of how to organize stuff.

## How MVC works üîπ

When building applications with the MVC design pattern in mind we want to divide our code into 3 parts. Model, View, and Controller. These 3 parts communicate with each other and dictate the flow of our application. The flow goes like this:

1. User interacts with the **VIEW**
2. **VIEW** tells the controller what the user requested
3. **CONTROLLER** processes and passes the request to the **MODEL**
4. **MODEL** requests data from the database
5. **MODEL** returns data to the **CONTROLLER**
6. **CONTROLLER** updates the **VIEW**
7. The user sees the data they requested in the **VIEW**

### Controller

The controller is the middle man of the whole operation. The controller has 2 main responsibilities.

- Accepting requests from the view ( user interactions ), processing those requests to a suitable format, and informing the model of the request
- Accepting data from the model, shaping it into a suitable response, and returning the response data to the view (a result that the user sees )

This means that we need to write or call some service that does some logic in the controller to get or give data to the user. It is the main link that connects the user and the data, but it is also the main separator that separates the user from the main data as well. This means that the view ( where the user interacts ) never knows what is happening with the data ( the model ). This makes our data much more secure and safe and also separates the concerns of our layers in the application.

### Model

The model is an entity that stores data. This data is usually business logic data, some valuable data about our application. The model is connected to some data structure, usually a database and it is the only entity in the application that can communicate with the raw data on the database. The model only accepts requests and gives data back to the controller. This means that the model does not know who is requesting the data or what is happening on the view. It only cares about fulfilling the request of the controller.

### View

The view is a representation of our application that concerns the users that are using the application. The view is tasked with handling the presentation of the data to the user. The view is connected to the controller and for any data that it needs to present to the user, it calls the controller to fetch it. It does not know what kind of data structure the application is using, nor does it knows how data is kept. It just asks for things and gets results from the controller.

## Why MVC is awesome üîπ

As you can imagine writing code in a huge chunk of a document is not the best way to start building an application. Neither does writing multiple files in one huge folder. This is bad because as the application grows it becomes harder to find and change things, when one part of the code is changed, everything must be changed as well and it is less secure because the code that the user has contact with is in direct contact with the real data of our application. All of this amounts to a REALLY SLOW development process and REALLY SAD developers. The MVC design pattern solves a lot of these issues by:

- Organizing the code making it easy to get around
- Structure the code so that we don't duplicate code
- Separate concerns so that we can easily change things without affecting the whole application
- Separate the user and the data so that users do not have direct contact with our data
- Scale and develop our application faster and safer
